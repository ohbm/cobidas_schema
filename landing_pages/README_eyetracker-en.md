  <p>The items reported were turned into

        now using.

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
corresponding to your methods and analysis. This is meant to make sure that you
have not forgotten any of the essential information during data collection or
later in the methods and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing
machine readable json files that captures information about your method/results
section

## Why this project?

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the
replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results
and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is
built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our
research.

## Want to help?

We have a [list](https://remi-gau.github.io/eCobidas/#goals) of short, middle,
long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in touch. Many of
them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills (except maybe a
certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be super
organized) :wink:.

For more information on the content and organization of these spreadsheets see
