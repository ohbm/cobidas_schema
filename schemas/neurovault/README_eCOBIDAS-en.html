    <h1>COBIDAS Information Collection Protocol</h1>
    <p>
      The aim of this protocol is to help users collect information related to
      the different components of the COBIDAS protocol.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>
      You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
      corresponding to your fMRI analysis. This is meant to make sure that you
      have not forgotten any of the essential information in the methods and
      results parts of your article.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, you can click on <b>Export</b> (bottom left) to get a zip file
      containing machine readable json files that captures information about
      your method/results section: our next step is to use this to automate the
      part of the methods writing and to submit the information alongside data
      submission to Neurovault and other data archives.
