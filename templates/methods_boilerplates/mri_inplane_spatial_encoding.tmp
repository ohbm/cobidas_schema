This data was acquired using {{NumberShots}} radio-frequency excitations,
with a phase encoding directon along {{PhaseEncodingDirection}}, with
an effective echo spacing {{EffectiveEchoSpacing}} seconds and total readout
time of {{TotalReadoutTime}}, using {{ParallelAcquisitionTechnique}} parallel imaging with a factor of
{{ParallelReductionFactorInPlane}}, a partial Fourrier of {{PartialFourier}}
in the {{PartialFourierDirection}} direction.
